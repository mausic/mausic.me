Hi, I'm Maksym.

I see myself as a product creator. I'm passionate about building products that solve problems or bring joy to people.

In various parts of my life, I've been wearing many hats: from theoretical physicist to entrepreneur, from software engineer to CTO.
I've been working in different industries and companies. I've been building products from scratch and scaling them to millions of users.
I've been a solo-develer in startup, and a team-lead moving a large company to success (not always).

This blog is about everything that I find interesting: from software engineering to product management, from entrepreneurship to personal development.

I will write here about my current projects, experiments, and thoughts, as well as about my past experiences, failures, and successes.

I'm passionate about music, and any life period of mine is associated with some aprticular music, song or artist.
I play guitar and sing. I also started learing an Ableton Live to create my own music.
I also love baking and cooking. I'm a big fan of sourdough bread and pizza.

If you'd like to contact me, please write to my email address: _contact [at] mausic.me_.
